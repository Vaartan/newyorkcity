        <h3>Getting around The City</h3>
        <p>
          New York is great for a walk ang getting things done on foot. Sometimes you will see the most by walking. That's also the best way to get familiar with all the neighborhoods, cultures, architecture and lot more New York City has to offer. But when you get tired or need to go to the other part of the city. Cabs are great and iconic way to move on. Of course, there is subway, bus, ferry... You name it, New York got it.

        <h3>History of New York City's skyline</h3>
        <p>
          The history of skyscrapers in New York City began with the completion of the World Building in 1890; the structure rose to 348 feet (106 m). Though not the city's first high-rise, it was the first building to surpass the 284-foot (87 m) spire of Trinity Church. The World Building, which stood as the tallest in the city until 1899, was demolished in 1955 to allow for the construction of an expanded entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. One of the tallest buildings are:
